    <h2>A quick short note on me.</h2>
    <p>
        I’m  someone who finds joy in creativity and self-expression. Writing poetry is one of my favorite outlets, where I explore themes like emotions, duality, and introspection. It’s my way of diving into deeper thoughts and connecting with the beauty of language.

I enjoy taking on projects that let me blend innovation and charm—whether it’s building platforms to empower others or crafting something lighthearted, like a cute website for spreading festive cheer.

Through everything I do, I aim to grow, contribute, and leave a little spark wherever I go.
